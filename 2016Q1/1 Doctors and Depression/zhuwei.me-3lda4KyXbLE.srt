00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,089
when I was an intern or a first-year
doctor in training I knew something was

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:08,900
wrong with me I had trouble sleeping I
had difficulty feeling joy I was prone

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,009
to crying at inopportune times even
worse I had trouble connecting with

4
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:17,449
patients I felt like I couldn't please
anyone and I found myself susceptible to

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:21,900
feelings of despair and panic I'm a
physician!  and if I do say so myself a very

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,340
well trained one yet it took an intern
support group the social worker that ran

7
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:31,129
it close friends and my then fiancee and
now wife to convince me that I might

8
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,439
need help even if I couldn't acknowledge
it they could see I was suffering from

9
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:43,399
depression I wasn't alone that's the
topic of this week's healthcare triage

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,350
last month the study in JAMA reviewed all
the literature on depression and

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,179
depressive symptoms and resident
physicians they found more than 50

12
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,909
studies on the subject research shows
that almost 30% of resident physician

13
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:02,079
suffer from either symptoms or a
diagnosis of depression the numbers and

14
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,760
how they compare to other professions
are almost beside the point

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,550
physicians are in a unique position of
needing to care for others continuously

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,540
that strain coupled with an inability
to help themselves

17
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:17,899
leaves both patients and doctors at risk
longitudinal studies or those that

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,549
follow resident over the course of their
training found that the rate of

19
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:21,550
depressive issues in residents
increased more than 15 percent within a
follow resident over the course of their
training found that the rate of

20
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,750
depressive issues in residents
increased more than 15 percent within a

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,879
year of beginning training. worse, physicians
exist in a profession where admitting a

22
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,409
problem carries with it a stigma that's
more impactful than in some others

23
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,679
a study published in 2008 surveyed
physicians in Michigan asking them about

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,060
their work experiences as well as their
depressive symptoms more than 11 percent

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,629
reported moderate to severe depression
scores about a quarter of them reported

26
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,819
knowing a doctor whose professional
standing had been hurt by being

27
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,799
depressed positions with moderate to
severe depression had a decrease in work

28
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,229
productivity and job satisfaction they
were also two to three times more likely

29
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,159
to say that they were worried about or
had difficulty getting mental health

30
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,469
care while the Americans with
Disabilities Act passed in 1990 prohibits

31
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,120
employers from asking broad questions
about illnesses when people apply for

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,939
jobs

33
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,989
state medical licensing board still ask
specific questions about mental health

34
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,650
because of this physicians are much more
likely to avoid treatment but also more

35
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,159
likely to self medicate sometimes that
medication is potentially appropriate as

36
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:31,409
with anti-depressants often it is not a
2012 study in JAMA surgery found that

37
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,719
more than 15% of the members of the
American College of Surgeons had a

38
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:39,669
scoreless screening tests consistent
with alcohol abuse or dependence among

39
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:45,119
female surgeons the prevalence was more
than 25% those who were depressed were

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,539
significantly more likely to abuse or be
dependent on alcohol

41
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,068
doctors have much easier access to drugs
than others as well because of this they

42
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,839
are more likely to misuse prescription
drugs than the general population

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,989
anesthesiologist have access to even
more drugs than other physicians and

44
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,810
their problems are even more common 2005
study of anesthesia residency training

45
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,209
programs found the eighty percent of
them reported experiences with impaired

46
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,919

with at least one abuse related death of

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,359
to further problems including suicide
more than 6 percent of surgeons report

50
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,419
suicidal ideation in the last year you don't 
**______** one-quarter of then **__saw?__* any kind of mental

51
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,810
health treatment most who did not fear 
the doing so would affect their ability

52
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,090
to obtain a license even though they
were worried about killing themselves

53
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,039
the problem is even worse among medical
trainees about 6 percent of them

54
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,620
reported thinking about suicide in the
last two weeks those with a history of

55
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,449
depression were almost four times as
likely to report recent suicidal

56
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:50,450
thoughts as those without too many
doctors act on suicidal impulses as well
depression were almost four times as
likely to report recent suicidal

57
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,858
thoughts as those without too many
doctors act on suicidal impulses as well

58
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,900
it's estimated that about 400 physicians
commit suicide each year that's about

59
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,439
three times as many doctors is wearing
my medical school class at the

60
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,098
University of Pennsylvania meta-analyses
estimate the rate of suicide among male

61
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,289
physicians is a hundred and forty
percent that of the general population

62
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:16,408
among female physicians it's almost two
hundred and thirty percent what makes

63
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:20,000
this important to discuss is not the
prevalence of depression and positions

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,598
and trainees although it's clearly too
high it's not whether physicians have

65
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,779
the highest suicide rate of any
professional though many people argue

66
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,299
that they do the critical issue here is
that too many positions especially

67
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,250
trainees suffer in silence afraid to ask
for help prepare that they will be

68
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,839
punished professionally if not
personally I've always been very open

69
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,819
about my time in residency

70
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:44,829
depression someone robbed me of a few
years of my life when I look back I

71
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:48,219
think the constant pressure to help
others coupled with frequent feelings of

72
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,699
helplessness wait on me a lack of sleep
and being away from family and friends

73
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:52,700
let me vulnerable seeing children have
bonded with and cared for deeply suffer
helplessness wait on me a lack of sleep

let me vulnerable seeing children have
bonded with and cared for deeply suffer

75
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:02,129
and die was often more than I could bear
and I think some part of me whether it

76
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,589
be physical behavior all is also
predisposed anxiety and depression but

77
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:10,399
I'm lucky thanks to the support of those
who love me as well as two excellent

78
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,949
therapist I'm no longer depressed I
remain vigilant however against a

79
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,610
recurrence it's important for me and for
all positions to stay on top of their

80
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,790
mental health not weight for a crisis to
act of also felt fortunate to be in a

to go for the rest of my life I'm sure
they'll find this episode concerning as

85
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:43,230
well but we can't not talk about this
too many of us are suffering and if they

86
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,800
can't get help from others they may try
and fail to help themselves

87
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,550
suicide is always a tragedy a physician
committing suicide is a travesty
