当我还是个实习生 或者第一年受训的医生\NWhen I was an intern, or a first-year doctor in training, 
我就知道我的状态出了问题\NI knew something was wrong with me. 
我时常失眠 郁郁寡欢\N I had trouble sleeping, I had difficulty feeling joy,
我会在不合适的时候有哭泣的冲动\NI was prone to crying at inopportune times.
更糟糕的是 我难以和病人沟通\NEven worse, I had trouble connecting with patients. 
我觉得我不能让任何人感到高兴\NI felt like I couldn't please anyone, 
我发现我常受绝望和恐慌情绪的影响\Nand I found myself susceptible to feelings of despair and panic.
我可是个医生 并非自负 我是个训练有素的医生\NI'm a physician! And if I do say so myself, a very well trained one.
即使如此 在实习生支持组和为其工作的社工\NYet it took an intern support group, the social worker that ran it,
我的亲友 以及我的未婚妻（现在的妻子）\Nclose friends and my then fiancee and now wife 
共同劝诱之下 我才认识到我需要帮助\Nto convince me that I might need help. 
即使我不承认\NEven if I couldn't acknowledge it, 
他们能够看出我正受抑郁症折磨\Nthey could see I was suffering from depression. 
我不是唯一的受害者 而这正是本期医疗速成课的主题 \NI wasn't alone! that's the topic of this week's healthcare triage.
在美国医学会杂志上个月发表的研究中\NLast month the study in JAMA 
研究者评审了所有关于常驻医师的抑郁和抑郁症状的文献\Nreviewed all the literature on depression and depressive symptoms in resident physicians.
他们发现了50多个相关的研究\NThey found more than 50 studies on the subject. 
研究表明 大约30%的常驻医师\NResearches show that almost 30% of resident physician
经受着抑郁症状的折磨 或者被确诊为抑郁症\Nsuffer from either symptoms, or a diagnosis of depression. 
具体的数字及其和其他职业的比较是无关紧要的\NThe numbers and how they compare to other professions are almost beside the point.
医师的职业特殊性使得他们需要长时间照顾他人\NPhysicians are in a unique position of needing to care for others continuously,
这个负担 加上他们难以帮助自己的事实\Nthat strain coupled with an inability to help themselves,
使医患二者都面对风险\Nleaves both patients and doctors at risk.
在跟踪调查住院医师的实习或受训过程的长期研究中\NLongitudinal studies or those that follow residencies over the course of their training, 
发现住院医师产生抑郁问题的概率\Nfound that the rate of depressive issues in residents 
在一年之内 与开始受训时相比增长了15%\Nincreased more than 15 percent within a year of beginning training. 
更糟糕的是 医师的职业使得如果他们承认问题\NWorse, physicians exist in a profession where admitting a problem 
会使得他们受到比其他职业相比更多的负面影响\Ncarries with it a stigma that's more impactful than in some others.
一个2008年发布的研究调查了密歇根的医师\NA study published in 2008 surveyed physicians in Michigan, 
询问了他们的工作体验和抑郁症状\Nasking them about their work experiences as well as their depressive symptoms. 
超过11%的医生被评为中到重度的抑郁\NMore than 11 percent reported moderate to severe depression scores. 
他们之中 有四分之一的人\NAbout a quarter of them reported knowing a doctor 
听闻有一些医生的职业地位受到抑郁症状的影响\Nwhose professional standing had been hurt by being depressed. 
患有中到重度抑郁的医生\NPhysicians with moderate to severe depression 
工作效率和工作体验都因此而下降\Nhad a decrease in work productivity and job satisfaction. 
同时他们有大于常人2至3倍的可能表明\NThey were also two to three times more likely to say 
担心 或者确实在心理健康方面难以得到帮助\Nthat they were worried about or had difficulty getting mental health care 
在1990通过的美国残疾人法案中\Nwhile the Americans with Disabilities Act passed in 1990 
禁止了雇主在选择求职者时明确地询问对方的疾病信息\Nprohibits employers from asking broad questions about illnesses when people apply for jobs,
但是 国家医疗执照委员会仍明确询问申请者的心理健康状态\Nstate medical licensing board still ask specific questions about mental health.
因此使得医师更有可能回避医疗措施\NBecause of this, physicians are much more likely to avoid treatment 
并且更有可能尝试自我治疗\Nbut also more likely to self medicate. 
此情况下 有时用药可能是合适的 比如抗抑郁药\NSometimes that medication is potentially appropriate, as with anti-depressants. 
但是在大多数情况下不是的\NOften it is not. 
一个2012年发表在美国医学会杂志外科板块的研究发现\N的A 2012 study in JAMA surgery found that 
美国外科医师学会中有超过15%的成员\Nmore than 15% of the members of the American College of Surgeons 
在鉴别测试中表现出了对酒精的滥用或依赖\Nhad a score on screening test consistent with alcohol abuse or dependence. 
在女性外科医师中 这个概率大于25%\NAmong female surgeons the prevalence was more than 25%. 
患有抑郁症的人滥用或者依赖酒精的倾向比常人更显著\NThose who were depressed were significantly more likely to abuse or be dependent on alcohol.
同时 医生比其他人更容易获取药物\Ndoctors have much easier access to drugs than others as well. 
因此他们比常人更有可能误用处方药物\NBecause of this they are more likely to misuse prescription drugs than the general population.
麻醉医生甚至能比一般医生获取更多种类的药物\NAnesthesiologist have access to even more drugs than other physicians 
因此在他们之中 误用药物的问题更加常见\Nand their problems are even more common. 
在一个2005年的对麻醉医师实训项目的研究中 \NA 2005 study of anesthesia residency training programs,
发现高达八成的成员表示曾见过不能正常工作的受训者\Nfound that eighty percent of them reported experiences with impaired residents
20%的人至少听闻一例受训医生因滥用药物而死亡的事件\Nand almost 20% had experiences with at least one abuse-related death of a doctor in training.
不幸的是 抑郁症和药物滥用可能导致更严重的问题 比如自杀\NUnfortunately, depression and substance abuse can lead to further problems including suicide 
超过6%的外科医生表明一年之内曾有自杀的想法\Nmore than 6 percent of surgeons report suicidal ideation in the last year 
但是其中只有四分之一的人寻求过某种心理治疗的帮助\Nyet only one-quarter of then sought any kind of mental health treatment. 
大多数不寻求帮助的人 害怕如此会使他们难以获得执照\NMost who did not fear the doing so would affect their ability to obtain a license, 
即使他们曾为自杀的想法而担心\Neven though they were worried about killing themselves.
这个问题在医疗实习生中更为严重\NThe problem is even worse among medical trainees. 
约6%的人表示在半个月之内曾有自杀的想法\NAbout 6 percent of them reported thinking about suicide in the last two weeks. 
那些有抑郁病史的人\NThose with a history of depression 
有大约高于他人四倍的可能产生自杀的想法\Nwere almost four times as likely to report recent suicidal thoughts as those without. 
另外 有太多的医生真的尝试了自杀\NToo many doctors act on suicidal impulses as well.
每年大约有400名医生自杀\NIt's estimated that about 400 physicians commit suicide each year, 
这个数字大约是\Nthat's about three times as many doctors 
我受教育的宾夕法尼亚大学医学班成员的三倍\Nas were in my medical school class at the University of Pennsylvania. 
综合分析结果发现 男性医师的自杀率\NMeta-analyses estimate the rate of suicide among male physicians 
大约是常人的140%\Nis a hundred and forty percent that of the general population.
对女性医师而言这个数字接近230%\NAmong female physicians it's almost two hundred and thirty percent. 
这个问题之所以重要\NWhat makes this important to discuss 
并不是因为医生和实习医生中抑郁症的普遍性\Nis not the prevalence of depression in physicians and trainees, 
虽然它明显很严重\Nalthough it's clearly too high, 
也不是因为医师的自杀率比任何其他职业都高\Nit's not whether physicians have the highest suicide rate of any professional, 
即使有的人认为确实如此\Nalthough many people argue that they do. 
最为关键的问题是 太多的医疗从业者 尤其是实习生\NThe critical issue here is that too many physicians especially trainees 
只是默默忍受痛苦 不敢寻求帮助\Nsuffer in silence, afraid to ask for help 
只是因为害怕他们的职业生涯或者个人受到负面影响\Nfor fear that they will be punished professionally if not personally. 
我一直对我实习期间的心理问题毫不避讳\NI've always been very open about my time in residency,
比如抑郁如何夺取了我生活中的几年时光\Nand how depression someone robbed me of a few years of my life. 
当我回首往事 我认为需要救助别人的长期压力\NWhen I look back, I think the constant pressure to help others 
以及时常等着我的无助感\Ncoupled with frequent feelings of helplessness wait on me, 
失眠 远离亲友 等原因都使我变得脆弱\Na lack of sleep and being away from family and friends left me vulnerable. 
眼见我深深关心的孩子饱受痛苦 甚至死去\NSeeing children I've bonded with and cared for deeply suffer and die 
常常使我无法承受\Nwas often more than I could bear. 
而且我感到我个人生理或是行为的某部分\NAnd I think some part of me whether it be physical or behavioral 
有焦虑和抑郁的倾向\Nis also predisposed to anxiety and depression. 
但是我很幸运 感谢那些爱我的人给予我的支持\NBut I'm lucky, thanks to the support of those who love me 
还有两名出色的心理治疗师的帮助 我已不再抑郁\Nas well as two excellent therapist, I'm no longer depressed. 
虽然我一直很小心 提防可能的复发\NI remain vigilant, however, against a recurrence. 
不管对我还是其他医师 了解自己的心理建康状态都很重要\NIt's important for me and for all physicians to stay on top of their mental health 
而不能坐等危机发生\Nand not wait for a crisis to act. 
我也有幸成为一名儿科医生 和一个让我集中的事情：科研\NI've also felt fortunate to be in a specialty: pediatrics and a focus: research
使我不怕我的心理问题被发现\Nwhere I didn't fear being found out. 
当我公开谈及心理治疗 或是我的未来人生规划时\NMany colleagues still recoil when I talked openly about therapy, 
我的很多同事仍表示不愿讨论此事\Nor how I plan to go for the rest of my life. 
我相信他们依然会觉得这个视频的内容很不合适\NI'm sure they'll find this episode concerning as well. 
但这是我们不得不讨论的问题\NBut we can't not talk about this.
有很多伙伴在痛苦之中 如果他们不能获得帮助\NToo many of us are suffering and if they can't get help from others, 
他们可能在自我帮助的过程中失败\Nthey may try and fail to help themselves.
自杀永远是一个悲剧 而一个医生的自杀则是荒谬的\NSuicide is always a tragedy. A physician committing suicide is a travesty.
